Sure! Let's walk through the revised code step by step:

### Code Breakdown

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    double averageWaitingTime(vector<vector<int>>& customers) {
        int currentTime = 0;
        long long totalWaitingTime = 0;
```
- **Headers and Namespaces:** We include the `<vector>` header for using the `vector` container. We also use the `std` namespace to avoid prefixing standard library names with `std::`.
- **Class Definition:** We define a class `Solution` with a public method `averageWaitingTime`.
- **Variables:**
  - `currentTime` keeps track of the current time in the restaurant, starting at 0.
  - `totalWaitingTime` accumulates the total waiting time for all customers. We use `long long` to handle potentially large sums.

```cpp
        for (const auto& customer : customers) {
            int arrivalTime = customer[0];
            int cookingTime = customer[1];
```
- **Loop Through Customers:** We iterate over each customer in the `customers` vector. Each customer is represented as a `vector<int>` with two elements: `arrivalTime` and `cookingTime`.
- **Extract Data:** For each customer, we extract `arrivalTime` and `cookingTime` from the vector.

```cpp
            if (currentTime < arrivalTime) {
                currentTime = arrivalTime;
            }
```
- **Update `currentTime`:** If the current time is less than the customer's arrival time, it means the cook is idle, and we update `currentTime` to the customer's arrival time.

```cpp
            currentTime += cookingTime;
            totalWaitingTime += (currentTime - arrivalTime);
```
- **Cooking Time:** We add the `cookingTime` to `currentTime`, indicating the end of this customer's service.
- **Calculate Waiting Time:** The waiting time for this customer is the difference between the time when their service is completed (`currentTime`) and their arrival time (`arrivalTime`). We add this waiting time to `totalWaitingTime`.

```cpp
        return static_cast<double>(totalWaitingTime) / customers.size();
    }
};
```
- **Calculate Average Waiting Time:** After the loop, we calculate the average waiting time by dividing `totalWaitingTime` by the number of customers (`customers.size()`). We use `static_cast<double>` to ensure the division is done in floating-point arithmetic, returning a `double` result.

### Summary
The code iterates through a list of customers, updating the current time and calculating the waiting time for each customer. The waiting time for a customer is the difference between when their service is completed and their arrival time. The total waiting time is accumulated, and at the end, the average waiting time is calculated and returned as a double. This ensures accurate floating-point division and handles large sums appropriately with `long long`.
