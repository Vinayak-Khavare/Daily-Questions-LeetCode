Sure, let's break down the improved code step by step:

### Includes:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
```
- `#include <vector>`: This includes the C++ Standard Library's vector class, which is a dynamic array that can resize itself automatically when elements are added or removed. In this code, vectors are used to store the input arrays (`nums1` and `nums2`) and the result array (`result`).
- `#include <unordered_map>`: This includes the C++ Standard Library's unordered_map class, which is a hash table used to store key-value pairs. In this code, the unordered_map is used to store the count of each element in the first array (`nums1`).

### Class Definition:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> intersect(std::vector<int>& nums1, std::vector<int>& nums2) {
```
- `class Solution`: This defines a class named `Solution`.
- `public`: This access specifier means that the following members are accessible from outside the class.
- `std::vector<int> intersect(std::vector<int>& nums1, std::vector<int>& nums2)`: This is a public member function of the `Solution` class that takes two vectors of integers by reference and returns a vector of integers.

### Variable Declarations:
```cpp
std::unordered_map<int, int> count_map;
std::vector<int> result;
```
- `std::unordered_map<int, int> count_map`: This creates an unordered_map named `count_map` that maps integers to integers. This map will store the count of each integer from `nums1`.
- `std::vector<int> result`: This creates a vector named `result` to store the intersection of `nums1` and `nums2`.

### Counting Occurrences:
```cpp
// Count occurrences of each element in nums1
for (int num : nums1) {
    count_map[num]++;
}
```
- This for-each loop iterates over each integer (`num`) in `nums1`. For each integer, it increments the corresponding value in `count_map`. This effectively counts how many times each integer appears in `nums1`.

### Finding Intersections:
```cpp
// Find intersections with nums2
for (int num : nums2) {
    if (count_map[num] > 0) {
        result.push_back(num);
        count_map[num]--;
    }
}
```
- This for-each loop iterates over each integer (`num`) in `nums2`. For each integer, it checks if the integer is present in `count_map` and if its count is greater than zero.
- If both conditions are true, it means the integer is part of the intersection, so it adds (`push_back`) the integer to the `result` vector and decrements the count in `count_map`.

### Return Statement:
```cpp
return result;
```
- Finally, the function returns the `result` vector, which contains the intersection of `nums1` and `nums2`.

This code efficiently finds the intersection of two arrays, handling duplicates correctly and achieving an average time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the sizes of the input arrays.
