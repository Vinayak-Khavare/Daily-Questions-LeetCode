Sure, let's break down and explain the original `reverseString` function step by step:

### Original Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        int n = s.size();
        int i = 0;
        int j = n - 1;

        char temp;

        while (i != j && i < j && j > i) {
            temp = s[i];
            s[i] = s[j];
            s[j] = temp;
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        return;        
    }
};
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization:**
   ```cpp
   int n = s.size();
   int i = 0;
   int j = n - 1;
   ```
   - `n` is assigned the size of the input vector `s`.
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (starting index).
   - `j` is initialized to `n - 1` (last index).

2. **Temporary Variable:**
   ```cpp
   char temp;
   ```
   - A temporary variable `temp` is declared to hold characters during the swapping process.

3. **While Loop:**
   ```cpp
   while (i != j && i < j && j > i) {
   ```
   - This loop continues as long as `i` is not equal to `j`, `i` is less than `j`, and `j` is greater than `i`.
   - These conditions are redundant; `i < j` alone is sufficient because it implies `i != j` and `j > i`.

4. **Swapping Characters:**
   ```cpp
   temp = s[i];
   s[i] = s[j];
   s[j] = temp;
   i++;
   j--;
   ```
   - The character at index `i` is stored in `temp`.
   - The character at index `j` is moved to index `i`.
   - The character in `temp` is assigned to index `j`.
   - `i` is incremented and `j` is decremented to move towards the center of the string.

5. **Return Statement:**
   ```cpp
   return;
   ```
   - The function returns, though this `return` statement is unnecessary since the function's return type is `void`.

### Redundant Conditions
- The condition `i != j && i < j && j > i` is redundant:
  - `i < j` alone is enough to ensure `i != j` and `j > i`.
  
### Simplified Version
Here's a simplified version of the function with an explanation for the improvements:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = s.size() - 1;

        while (i < j) {
            std::swap(s[i], s[j]);
            i++;
            j--;
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Improvements:
1. **Simplified Conditions:**
   - The while loop now only checks `i < j`, which is sufficient.
   
2. **Using `std::swap`:**
   - `std::swap(s[i], s[j])` swaps the elements at indices `i` and `j`, making the code cleaner and more readable.
   
3. **Eliminated Temporary Variable:**
   - `std::swap` removes the need for a temporary variable, reducing potential errors and improving clarity.

This version of the function is more concise, easier to read, and maintain.
