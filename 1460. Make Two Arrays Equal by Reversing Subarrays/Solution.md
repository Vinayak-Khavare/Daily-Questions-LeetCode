Certainly! The provided code defines a function `canBeEqual` in the `Solution` class, which checks if one array (`arr`) can be transformed into another array (`target`) by reordering its elements. Essentially, it determines if both arrays are permutations of each other.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the function works:

### Class Definition
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canBeEqual(vector<int>& target, vector<int>& arr) {
```
This defines a class named `Solution` with a public member function `canBeEqual` that takes two references to vectors of integers, `target` and `arr`, and returns a boolean value.

### Function Logic

1. **Initialize the Hash Map**
    ```cpp
    unordered_map<int, int> m;
    ```
    - An unordered map `m` is created to keep track of the counts of elements. The keys in the map are the elements of the arrays, and the values are their respective counts (positive for `target` and negative for `arr`).

2. **Update the Hash Map**
    ```cpp
    for (int i = 0; i < target.size(); i++) {
        m[target[i]] += 1;
        m[arr[i]] -= 1;
    }
    ```
    - This `for` loop iterates through the elements of both arrays.
    - For each element in `target`, the count in the map is incremented by `1`.
    - For each element in `arr`, the count in the map is decremented by `1`.
    - By the end of this loop, if both arrays contain the same elements with the same frequencies, the counts for all elements in the map should balance out to zero.

3. **Check the Hash Map**
    ```cpp
    for (auto x : m) {
        if (x.second != 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    ```
    - This `for` loop iterates over the entries in the map.
    - If any entry has a non-zero count, it means the arrays do not have the same elements with the same frequencies, and thus, `arr` cannot be transformed into `target`.
    - If all counts are zero, it means the arrays are permutations of each other.

4. **Return the Result**
    ```cpp
    return true;
    ```
    - If all counts in the map are zero, the function returns `true`, indicating that `arr` can be rearranged to match `target`.

### Summary
The function `canBeEqual` determines if the two given arrays, `target` and `arr`, are permutations of each other. It uses an unordered map to count occurrences of each element in both arrays. By incrementing the count for elements in `target` and decrementing for elements in `arr`, the function ensures that if the final counts are all zero, the arrays are permutations of each other.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the arrays. The function makes a single pass through the arrays and a pass through the map.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(k)\), where \(k\) is the number of unique elements in the arrays. This is due to the space used by the unordered map to store the counts.

Overall, this approach efficiently determines if two arrays are permutations of each other by leveraging a hash map to count and compare the elements.
