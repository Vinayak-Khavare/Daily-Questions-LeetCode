Certainly! Let's break down the `passThePillow` function in the given `Solution` class.

### Function Overview
The function `passThePillow` simulates the passing of a pillow between `n` people in a circular manner for a given amount of `time`. The function returns the position of the pillow after the given time has elapsed.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `int i = 0;` initializes the starting position of the pillow to the first person (position 0).
   - `int direction = 0;` initializes the direction of passing. `0` indicates passing to the right (next person), and `1` indicates passing to the left (previous person).

2. **While Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `time` is non-negative.
   - Within each iteration of the loop, the following steps occur:

3. **Direction Change Check**:
   - If `i == 1`, the direction is set to `0`, indicating the pillow should be passed to the right.
   - If `i == n`, the direction is set to `1`, indicating the pillow should be passed to the left.

4. **Pass the Pillow**:
   - If `direction == 0` (passing to the right), increment `i` by 1 to move to the next person, and decrement `time` by 1.
   - If `direction == 1` (passing to the left), decrement `i` by 1 to move to the previous person, and decrement `time` by 1.

5. **Return the Position**:
   - The function returns the current position of `i` when `time` becomes negative.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's consider an example with `n = 3` (3 people) and `time = 4`.

Initial State:
- `i = 0` (starting position)
- `direction = 0` (initial direction to the right)
- `time = 4`

1. First iteration:
   - `i` increments to 1 (`i = 1`)
   - `time` decrements to 3 (`time = 3`)

2. Second iteration:
   - `i` increments to 2 (`i = 2`)
   - `time` decrements to 2 (`time = 2`)

3. Third iteration:
   - `i` increments to 3 (`i = 3`)
   - `time` decrements to 1 (`time = 1`)

4. Fourth iteration:
   - `i` cannot increment beyond `3` (since `n = 3`), so `direction` changes to `1` (passing to the left)
   - `i` decrements to 2 (`i = 2`)
   - `time` decrements to 0 (`time = 0`)

5. Fifth iteration:
   - `i` decrements to 1 (`i = 1`)
   - `time` decrements to -1 (`time = -1`)

Now `time` is negative, so the loop ends, and the function returns the current position of `i`, which is `1`.

### Conclusion
The function effectively simulates passing a pillow among `n` people for a specified amount of `time` and returns the final position of the pillow. The direction of passing changes appropriately when the boundaries (person 1 and person `n`) are reached.
