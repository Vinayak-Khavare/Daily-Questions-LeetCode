Let's break down the provided C++ code to understand how it works and what it aims to achieve.

### Class Definition and Method Signature

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countTriplets(vector<int>& arr) {
```

The `Solution` class contains a public method `countTriplets` which takes a reference to a vector of integers (`arr`) and returns an integer. This method counts the number of triplets `(i, j, k)` in the array such that the bitwise XOR of the elements from `i` to `j-1` is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements from `j` to `k`.

### Variables and Prefix XOR Array

```cpp
        int n = arr.size();
        vector<int> prefix(n+1, 0);
```

- `n` is the size of the input array `arr`.
- `prefix` is a vector of size `n+1` initialized with 0s. This will store the prefix XOR values.

### Building the Prefix XOR Array

```cpp
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            prefix[i+1] = prefix[i]^arr[i];
        }
```

This loop constructs the `prefix` array where `prefix[i+1]` holds the XOR of all elements in `arr` from the beginning up to index `i`. The prefix XOR array helps in efficiently computing the XOR of any subarray in constant time.

### Counting Triplets

```cpp
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            for(int k=i+1; k<n; k++){
                if(prefix[i]==prefix[k+1]){
                    count+=(k-i);
                }
            }
        }
```

- `count` is initialized to 0. It will keep track of the number of valid triplets.
- The nested loops iterate over all pairs `(i, k)` where `0 <= i < k < n`.

#### Inner Logic

The condition `if(prefix[i]==prefix[k+1])` checks if the XOR of the subarray from the beginning to `i-1` is equal to the XOR of the subarray from the beginning to `k`. If this condition is true, it means the XOR of elements from `i` to `k` is 0, satisfying one part of the condition for a valid triplet.

When `prefix[i] == prefix[k+1]`, all indices `j` such that `i < j <= k` will form a valid triplet. Therefore, the number of such `j` values is `(k - i)`, which is added to `count`.

### Return Statement

```cpp
        return count;
    }
};
```

Finally, the method returns the total count of valid triplets.

### Summary

The code counts the number of triplets `(i, j, k)` in the array such that the XOR of elements from `i` to `j-1` is equal to the XOR of elements from `j` to `k`. It uses a prefix XOR array to efficiently compute XOR values of subarrays and nested loops to find and count all valid triplets. The condition `prefix[i] == prefix[k+1]` ensures that the subarrays meet the required criteria, and the count is updated accordingly.
