Certainly! The provided code defines a class `Solution` with a method `singleNumber` that identifies elements in a given vector `nums` that appear exactly once. Here's a detailed explanation:

### Code Breakdown

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> singleNumber(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        std::unordered_map<int, int> dict;

        // Count occurrences of each number in nums
        for (auto x : nums) {
            ++dict[x];
        }

        std::vector<int> res;
        // Collect numbers that appear exactly once
        for (auto pair : dict) {
            if (pair.second == 1) {
                res.push_back(pair.first);
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Headers and Class Declaration**:
    ```cpp
    #include <vector>
    #include <unordered_map>
    ```
    - The code includes headers for `vector` and `unordered_map` which are necessary for using these STL containers.
    ```cpp
    class Solution {
    public:
        ...
    };
    ```
    - The `Solution` class is defined with public access specifier, meaning the methods inside it can be accessed from outside the class.

2. **Method Definition**:
    ```cpp
    std::vector<int> singleNumber(std::vector<int>& nums)
    ```
    - The `singleNumber` method is defined to return a `std::vector<int>` and takes a reference to a `std::vector<int>` as its parameter.

3. **Counting Occurrences**:
    ```cpp
    std::unordered_map<int, int> dict;

    for (auto x : nums) {
        ++dict[x];
    }
    ```
    - An `unordered_map<int, int>` named `dict` is declared to store each number from `nums` as keys and their counts as values.
    - The `for` loop iterates through each element `x` in the `nums` vector, incrementing the corresponding count in `dict`. This loop effectively counts how many times each number appears in the `nums` vector.

4. **Collecting Single Occurrence Numbers**:
    ```cpp
    std::vector<int> res;
    for (auto pair : dict) {
        if (pair.second == 1) {
            res.push_back(pair.first);
        }
    }
    ```
    - A `std::vector<int>` named `res` is declared to store the result.
    - The `for` loop iterates through each key-value pair (`pair`) in the `dict`. If the value (`pair.second`) is `1` (indicating the number appears exactly once), the corresponding key (`pair.first`) is added to the `res` vector.

5. **Return Statement**:
    ```cpp
    return res;
    ```
    - Finally, the method returns the `res` vector, which contains all the numbers that appeared exactly once in the input vector `nums`.

### Example Usage

Here is an example to illustrate how this method works:

```cpp
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<int> nums = {4, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2};
    std::vector<int> result = sol.singleNumber(nums);
    for (int num : result) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:
- The `nums` vector contains the elements `{4, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2}`.
- After counting occurrences, `dict` will be `{4: 2, 3: 2, 2: 2, 1: 1}`.
- The method then collects the numbers that appear exactly once (`1`) and returns `{1}`.

### Performance Considerations

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because the algorithm iterates through `nums` once to count occurrences and then through the map to collect results.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the storage requirements for the `unordered_map` which, in the worst case, stores all `n` elements.

This code efficiently finds and returns the elements that appear exactly once in the input vector.
