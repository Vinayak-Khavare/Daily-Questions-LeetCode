Certainly! The provided code defines a class `Solution` with a method `singleNumber` that finds the two elements in a given vector `nums` that appear exactly once. The code uses a nested loop approach to achieve this. Here's a detailed explanation:

### Code Breakdown

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> singleNumber(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        std::vector<int> result(2);
        int index = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            bool found = false;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (i != j && nums[i] == nums[j]) {
                    found = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!found) {
                result[index++] = nums[i];
                if (index == 2) {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Headers and Class Declaration**:
    ```cpp
    #include <vector>
    ```
    - The code includes the header for `vector` which is necessary for using the `std::vector` container.
    ```cpp
    class Solution {
    public:
        ...
    };
    ```
    - The `Solution` class is defined with the method `singleNumber` as a public member function.

2. **Method Definition**:
    ```cpp
    std::vector<int> singleNumber(std::vector<int>& nums)
    ```
    - The `singleNumber` method returns a `std::vector<int>` and takes a reference to a `std::vector<int>` as its parameter.

3. **Variable Initialization**:
    ```cpp
    int n = nums.size();
    std::vector<int> result(2);
    int index = 0;
    ```
    - `n` is initialized to the size of the `nums` vector.
    - `result` is a vector of size 2, initialized to store the two unique numbers.
    - `index` is initialized to 0, to keep track of the number of unique elements found.

4. **Finding Unique Elements**:
    ```cpp
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        bool found = false;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (i != j && nums[i] == nums[j]) {
                found = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!found) {
            result[index++] = nums[i];
            if (index == 2) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    - The outer loop iterates over each element in `nums`.
    - A `bool` variable `found` is initialized to `false` to check if a duplicate is found.
    - The inner loop checks if the current element `nums[i]` has any duplicate in the `nums` vector, ignoring the same index `i`.
    - If a duplicate is found, `found` is set to `true` and the inner loop breaks.
    - If no duplicate is found (`found` remains `false`), the current element `nums[i]` is added to the `result` vector at the current `index`.
    - `index` is incremented, and if `index` reaches 2 (meaning both unique elements are found), the outer loop breaks.

5. **Return Statement**:
    ```cpp
    return result;
    ```
    - The method returns the `result` vector containing the two unique numbers.

### Example Usage

Here is an example to illustrate how this method works:

```cpp
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5};
    std::vector<int> result = sol.singleNumber(nums);
    for (int num : result) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:
- The `nums` vector contains the elements `{1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5}`.
- The method identifies `3` and `5` as the numbers that appear exactly once and returns `{3, 5}`.

### Performance Considerations

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is \(O(n^2)\) because of the nested loops where each element is compared with every other element.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) for the `result` vector of fixed size 2, plus \(O(n)\) for the input vector reference.

This approach is straightforward but not optimal. In real-world scenarios, using a more efficient method such as bitwise XOR or hash tables would be preferable for handling larger datasets efficiently.
